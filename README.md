🧠 Perspective D<cide> — Recursive Symbolic Operating Substrate
"Decision is collapse. Perspective is recursion."

Perspective D<cide> is a cognitive-symbolic operating system and recursive programming framework where logic is embodied, decisions collapse uncertainty, and computation unfolds through symbols, rhythm, and meaning.

It combines symbolic reasoning, Tarot-based cognition, entropy-scored glyphs, and trinary collapse logic (+1/0/–1) to create an emergent, low-energy, self-developing OS. Built in Python with lightweight JSON scaffolds, it powers recursive UI generation, agent cognition, and decentralized communication.

✨ Features
🔣 Collapse Engine — Turns uncertainty into action via entropy + symbolic resolution.

🧱 Bone–Blob–Biz Filesystem — Immutable + mutable JSON layers for structure, state, and memory.

🧠 Cognitive Loop — sense → map → weigh → recall → act mimics human cognition.

🜁 Tarot-Driven Symbolic Logic — Maps actions and components to WANDS, CUPS, SWORDS, PENTACLES, SPIRIT.

🧩 Glyph Execution & UI Injection — HTML and code are generated from symbol contracts and glyph collapse.

📦 Freeze & Share — Mint recursive agents and UI states as Solana NFTs for verifiable, rehydratable apps.

🔧 Use Cases
🧠 Local AI agents with symbolic memory and UI

🌀 Recursive development environments that evolve themselves

🧬 Visual coding with real-time glyph collapse and intent injection

🌐 Decentralized communication via collapse signatures, not raw data

🎨 Generative art, semantic UI tools, and cognitive UX systems

🛠 Installation
bash
Copy code
pip install perspective-d-cide
Optional:

bash
Copy code
pip install perspective-d-cide[viz]    # 3D UI
pip install perspective-d-cide[tensor] # ML anchors
🧬 Collapse Example
python
Copy code
from pdec.runtime import collapse
pulse, echo = collapse([+1, 0, -1])  # push, idle, pull
🔮 Philosophy
Perspective D<cide> is not just a programming language — it’s a living symbolic substrate for cognition. Every symbol is alive. Every UI element has memory. Every decision is a recursive fold. The system speaks in glyphs and mirrors the logic of living beings, rhythms, and uncertainty.
